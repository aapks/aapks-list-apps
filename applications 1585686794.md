You can still buy the unlocker to remove all ads and enable background scanning. Without root access, Undeleter can scan app caches for images. App caches can contain images that would not otherwise be discoverable: you may find photos that were shared with you on social media but you never opened, or lower quality copies of images you have now or have deleted in the past. They may also contain images that have been preloaded by your browser or other apps on your device - even images of people you don't know. They can be filtered out using "Hide extant files". Deep scan heuristically scans for and recovers the following types of files: BMP, JPEG/JPG, PNG, MNG, JNG, GIF, MP4, AVI, MKV, MP3, OGG, OGM, WAV, FLAC, AMR, MP4A, PDF, SXD, SXI, SXC, SXW, ODT, ODG, ODS, ODP, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ZIP, JAR, APK, EPUB. Data scanning is available for a select number of apps, including the system phone and SMS applications. Data will be recovered in the form or HTML files for WhatsApp and Viber, as we cannot merge third-party catalogs. Shred/secure delete: Files found on free disk areas can be erased permanently in bulk using the Shred function. You can also use the system-wide Share menu to securely erase files directly through any other app, for example by opening the gallery, selecting a number of images, pressing the Share button and selecting Secure delete.

BlockLauncher Pro 1.27
Support for Minecraft 1.11.1
BlockLauncher Pro is a custom MCPE launcher that loads mods and texture packs.
Minecraft with benefits If you’re into Minecraft this one might be handy. Blocklauncher is a Minecraft PE launcher that lets you load texture packs, servers, patches, skins and much more. Choose ‘Options’ in the main screen and then tap ‘Mods’. You’re welcome. In case you don’t know, Minecraft is a building game. It’s a little like LEGO and a little like Lincoln Logs. You take various textured cubes and build what you want. So where does the mining come in? The word “mine” is used loosely here. Gathering up trees is, in a sense, mining. You turn them into wood and then make your own structures. Finding the materials to make your own tools to build the wood into, say, a mansion, is mining too! It’s not just fun, it’s also really creative. You’re limited only by your own brain … and the time you put in. There are plenty of achievements to get as you go along, such as when you make a furnace, open your inventory for the first time or catch a fish. Eventually, you’ll learn to make fire and electricity. If you play a really long time, you might even find the elusive Ender Dragon. So go wild on Minecraft. Build like a modern architect. Build like a steampunk novelist. Build like a pioneer. Build high or long or with moats and forests. Build a Scout jamboree park. Then, tear it all down if you like! IMPORTANT: MAY NOT WORK ON SOME SAMSUNG DEVICES with Knox security options.

Your documents will be saved on the cloud, so you can access them wherever you are and can be sure they are protected and safe. This app is free to view, create and edit documents, however, if you are looking for the entire Word experience, you will have to have an Office 365 subscription. The app uses your device’s screen as a touch-first approach, making it very easy to use and to understand. If you want to start creating your document and need to have the possibility of working remotely or wherever you go, download Microsoft Word now.

Color Days Widget 1.8
- Version without ads - Added indicator of ovulation - Added setting of duration of menstruation - Increased period (20 - 46) - Fixed bugs

So what you get as a result: 1. the calendar is formed according to the natural cycle 2. the story remains in process of use. The doctor's question: When did you last have menses? will not take you aback. 3. the next cycles can be forecast so it is easy to see the day of the next menses. 4. the days in a calender a remarked in different colours. Simple coloured scheme can help to understand quickly and easily to which phase of the cycle the day refers. It is useful when planning a family, having sex or just organising your time. Widget can be adjusted to the current cycle so that at any moment it is possible to define the day of the cycle and its condition (colour). You don't even need to open the application. To be in the know men also can install this application and mood differences of a girlfriend can become predictable. ======================== Installation: ======================== To place Widget to the Home Screen, long press on the screen and then select "Color Days" from the widgets list. If you could not find widget restart your device ======================== Attention: ========================- On some versions of Android (4.0.3 and up) the Widgets may not appear in the widget list after installation. REBOOT YOUR DEVICE to solve this issue!!! - The application does not guarantee an exact coincidence of a predicted cycle with an individual one. - To predict the cycle the "Standard Days Method" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar-based_contraceptive_methods) has been used. ======================== Any responses and wishes to the application are welcomed.

Note: This service may be pre-installed by your device manufacturer to allow the ANT wireless hardware already present in your mobile device to operate. If you do not use this feature it will remain inactive. v.4.15: -Support more private network keys -Various bug fixes [Full changelog coming on our GitHub SDK README.]
Enables ANT and ANT+ wireless technology in your phone or using an ANT USB stick
ANT is a wireless protocol, similar to Bluetooth®, that is predominantly used for sport and fitness wireless connectivity. Pre-installed by the phone manufacturer, this service allows you to connect ANT+ devices to apps on your phone. ANT Wireless is a division of Garmin Canada Inc. ANT enabled apps can utilize this service to connect: • Heart Rate: Receive live heart rate data from heart rate straps or wearables produced by many popular manufacturers • Fitness Equipment: Connect ANT+ enabled fitness equipment and bicycle trainers to popular training and workout apps • Bike Speed and Cadence: Capture bike speed, distance, and/or cadence data • Bike Power: Capture data from ANT+ cycling power meters such as Garmin Vector • Stride-based Speed and Distance Monitor: Capture speed and distance data from running footpods For a full list of compatible ANT+ apps and devices visit https://www.thisisant.com/directory/ FAQ: How did this app get on my phone and is it spyware? This service is standard software, included by the manufacturer of your phone. It is not illegally downloaded, and it is not spyware. It will not cause system malfunctions or pop-up ads to appear. It is not bloatware and typically uses a max of 20 MB of space. For example, on a 16GB phone, this service takes up 0.0013% of space. We do not pay phone manufacturers to have this service pre-installed. How can I remove this service? Since this service is standard software, you’re unable to delete it from your phone. Instead, you can disable this service by following the manufacturer’s instructions. The typical process is: settings>applications>application manager>appropriate app>force stop>disable Disabling this service will not affect your phone’s software. If, in the future, you require the ability to connect to services and devices via ANT+, just enable the service again. NOTE: Since this is a factory installed service, it may enable/re-download if you reset and/or update your phone. Don’t panic! Just follow the instructions to disable it again. Does this service track me without my knowledge? No. The ANT Radio Service and ANT+ Plugins Service applications provide a wireless connectivity service, similar to Bluetooth or WiFi, but with very low power. These services do not collect any personal data. Is it difficult to develop an app with ANT+ capabilities and is there a fee? Using the ANT+ plugins in your app to communicate with ANT+ devices is quick, easy, free and uses a simple API. Visit the ANT Android Developer page (http://www.thisisant.com/developer/ant/ant-in-android) for more information and to download the SDK. How do I know if I own any ANT enabled products? Visit https://www.thisisant.com/directory to search for ANT/ANT+ enabled products, devices and/or services.

SuperSU manages root access for your apps - requires a rooted device!
The access management tool of the future SuperSU is one of the world’s most famous root-only apps. It acts like a security guard for your phone, helping you manage permissions and ensure apps don’t overstep their boundaries. Great compatibility and no ads make this app a crowd favorite. SuperSU keeps track of which apps you've granted root permissions to and will automatically grant those permissions again the next time you run that app. You can always go back and see which apps you've granted root permissions to, revoke them, or see how frequently they use it. You can even use SuperSU to temporarily unroot your device and the app even works when Android isn't properly booted, giving you a great tool to troubleshoot issues if your phone is stuck in boot loops. The tool will also log how often those apps request root, whether they do so in the background, and even works even in recovery mode. IMPORTANT: In order to make SuperSU work you need to root your phone. Rooting can be done through two methods: using Android Application Package (APK), which is usually provided by 3rd party rooting service; or manually granting root access (can be achieved in recovery mode).

Voice Search 3.0.1
* Bugfixes

Tell your device what you need just by using your voice with this entirely handsfree app. Sometimes you need to get an information but can’t search it on your mobile phone because you’re either driving, or are in any other complicated situation. If you usually experience this issue, you should download Voice Actions for Android. This app allows you to use only your voice to search and navigate your phone without having to hold it and type in your search. This allows you to not only search for things on your phone, but also on the internet, such as useful information and directions to a nearby location. Voice Actions is specially useful when you’re driving and you need to make a call, get directions or read a message but can’t stop the vehicle at the time. You simply need to ask for your phone to call a contact on your phone, say where you want directions to, ask for it to read your latest message out loud or for suggestions on nearby restaurants, shops, gas station or other useful point. Never get lost again because you can’t use your phone and don’t wait until you’re stopped to answer that important work email as you can use Voice Actions to read the email and then dictate your response and send it right away. Download the app now, but please note that currently it’s only available in US English.

Saving time & avoiding traffic is even easier with this update: - Fixed a bug that caused the map to freeze when opening another app
Save time on every drive. Waze tells you about traffic, police, crashes & more
I said a... turn right here! Imagine being guided home to the voice of Elvis Presley. Dream about creating a list of appointments and tap the screen to access their locations. What if friends nearby could update you on accidents, traffic jams, speed cams and the presence of police? Wake up, fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride. Waze makes this all happen. Free, accurate and feature-packed, the beauty of Waze resides in its community-based updates. You won’t get fancy 3D buildings or topographic data like Google Maps. Its millions of users who are actively and passively sharing data points would make any cartographer proud. Drive along as Waze will notify you via popups of incidents within a preset radius or along a chosen route. Waze will also display popup ads for nearby business but only when the vehicle is stopped. There are also voice commands like ‘Drive Home’ or ‘Report Heavy Traffic’. Also included are social features (facebook connection), game mechanics (earn points and find digital treats on the maps), a Map Chat feature that lets you leave messages and photos on the map for other drivers to browse and a fuel price tool where you can find and report the latest updates and changes to the prices. And yes. You can set up Elvis as your GPS best buddy!
